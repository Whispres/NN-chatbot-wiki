## Bot Account Registration Help
#### Discord
* Register a bot application with Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
* For help, see the Discord [Creating a Bot Account Guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/discord.html).

#### Twitch
* Register a bot application with Twitch [here](https://glass.twitch.tv/console/apps/create).
* For help, see the Twitch Apps & Authentication [section on Registration](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/#registration).
* **NOTE:** Set the redirect URI to http://localhost during development, or if the bot does not need OAuth. Twitch will only redirect to the URI in the event of an OAuth flow.
 * See more information on OAuth [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth/), and an explanation of how Twitch chatbots use OAuth [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/).

#### Stack Exchange Network
A separate account for the bot is required on each site.
